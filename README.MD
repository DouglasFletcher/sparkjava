# Spark Java implementation
The purpose of this repository is to develop a model example with Java and Spark API. The business developement oppotunity is also targeted to Risk & Fraud analytics 
Group (But could easily be used in any other model or data processing application).
The case example uses a kaggle repository https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit. All data for the models are stored on this site. In addition Random Forest implementation has 
been taken from one of the solutions. More information is on the site, however basically credit worthiness is predicted in this example (classic Risk & Fraud Analytics case study). The 
Spark API is used to develop the same model, using the same variables. This can be used as a template to setup spark, see how the API can be used in comparison for Java. The case sample 
has been developed in a way that most users of Java can access this example relatively easy and use it as a reference.
